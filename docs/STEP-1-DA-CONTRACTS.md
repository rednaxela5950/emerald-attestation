# Step 1 — DA data model & core contracts

Status: In progress

Plan:
- Define `EmeraldPostRegistry` data model and events.
- Stub `EmeraldDaAdapter` storage/events for Phase 1 decisions and custody placeholders.
- Add simple `MockKzgVerifier`.
- Cover registry/adapter interactions with Foundry tests for the shell flow.
