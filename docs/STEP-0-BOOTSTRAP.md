# Step 0 — Bootstrap

Status: Done

Plan:
- Create repo layout for contracts, worker package, and frontend app.
- Initialize Foundry config plus Node/TypeScript workspace basics.
- Add baseline README and gitignore for contracts and node artifacts.
- Prepare initial scaffold commit (`chore: bootstrap project`).

Result:
- Scaffolded repo layout with Foundry config, pnpm/TypeScript workspace, and baseline README/gitignore.
