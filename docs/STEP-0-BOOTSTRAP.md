# Step 0 — Bootstrap

Status: In progress

Plan:
- Create repo layout for contracts, worker package, and frontend app.
- Initialize Foundry config plus Node/TypeScript workspace basics.
- Add baseline README and gitignore for contracts and node artifacts.
- Prepare initial scaffold commit (`chore: bootstrap project`).
